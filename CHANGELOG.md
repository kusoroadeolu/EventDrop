### 9/18/25

### 9/24/25
#### Added
UI/UX improvements

+ Feat: Made the app a pwa for 

#### Fixed 
+ Fixed a race condition where multiple events tried to emit at once causing an sse disconnect and keeping the user in the room. 
Averted this by adding a queue based implementation, whereby events can only be emitted one at a time. Tradeoff is that events arent async anymore
but the frontend state is less prone to errors
